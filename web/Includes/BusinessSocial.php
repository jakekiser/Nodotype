        <h1>Social Business</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Members of Digiapolis have been focused on the concepts of social for the last 10+ years, well before the term was coined.  Only in the past couple of years has the term been truly understood as a concept by the masses.  With consumer level products such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others, more and more people have come to understand what it is and what the value is.</p>
        <p>Business has found “Social” to be of great value in the “broadcasting” of communications for their company – many are integrating their blogs and tweeting their ideas and assertions into the “socialsphere”.  The focus has been outbound communication and interaction benefitting web site SEO, awareness of products and offerings, and hopefully new customers.  But is this enough to differentiate your company?</p>
        <p>Digiapolis consultants and developers are experts in social.  Not just integrating your messages into standard consumer level tools – but also in building custom, private communities for your company integrated into your web site, customer operations, and just about any external social or operational tool desired.

        <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Ask yourself some basic questions. Do I want more customers? Am I compelling my customers to consider my company strategic to their organization? Am I truly helping my customers gain ground and introducing them to others like them that extends their value in working with my company? If you answer "no" to any of these questions, we need to talk.</p>
