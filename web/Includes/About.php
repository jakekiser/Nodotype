<p>I bring more than 30 years of experience managing, developing and marketing high-end enterprise class software solutions in the ERP, Business Intelligence, CRM, Cloud, Social and Collaboration areas. My experience includes the development of solutions as well as the development and management of people, including budgeting, planning, strategic visioning, analyst relations, and successfully working with internal and external teams.</p>
<p>In addition to my ERP, and early pioneering in Business Intelligence, I am also a proven entrepreneur with early SaaS/Web 2.0, I have developed a strong track record of visioning and developing high-end collaboration/community sites for organizations such as the Mayo Clinic, Geek Squad, Microsoft, Lawson Software, and Cerner Healthcare. I am the founder and was President and key engineer/architect for DigitalConcourse.com; a commercial, web 2.0, digital community platform that focuses on private customer based digital communities that drive affinity and marketing opportunities for organizations. DigitalConcourse.com was sold to Velocity Technology Solutions in 2008.</p>
<p>I focus on bringing fresh, innovative ideas, sleeves up execution experience, and a positive attitude to the teams I manage and participate in.</p>
